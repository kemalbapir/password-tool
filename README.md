# Password Strength & Security Awareness Tool

This project is a simple, web-based security tool designed to evaluate password strength and promote secure authentication practices. The tool helps users understand how password length, character diversity, and entropy impact resistance to brute-force and guessing attacks.

## Purpose
The purpose of this tool is to raise security awareness and encourage the creation of strong passwords. Weak or predictable passwords are a common cause of account compromise. This tool provides immediate feedback and recommendations to reduce that risk.

## Features
- Evaluates password strength (Weak / Medium / Strong)
- Measures password length and character diversity
- Estimates password entropy
- Provides an approximate brute-force attack time (educational estimate)
- Displays actionable security recommendations
- Fully client-side (no data is stored or transmitted)

## Technology Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript (client-side)

## How This Tool Contributes to Information Security
This tool supports information security by promoting strong authentication practices and improving user awareness of password-related threats. It helps reduce the risk of credential-based attacks such as brute-force, password spraying, and credential stuffing. The tool aligns with defensive security principles and CEH domains related to authentication security and password attacks.

## Usage
1. Open the public website link.
2. Enter a password in the input field.
3. Review the strength score, entropy, and security recommendations.
4. Apply the guidance to create stronger passwords and enable additional controls such as multi-factor authentication (MFA).

## Disclaimer
This tool is intended for educational and awareness purposes only. Password strength results and brute-force time estimates are approximate and may vary based on attack methods, hashing algorithms, and system defenses.
